# metaheuristics

Contains class for two different metaheuristics; a genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.

The genetic algorithm can solve either real-valued optimization problems or sequence optimization problems.

The simulated annealing algorithm solves multiobjective optimization problems, and has methods specific to real-valued problems.
